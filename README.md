The repo contains a few Dockerfiles to build the Caffe deep learning framework (https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) using nvidia's docker tool, nvidia-docker (https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). Nvidia-docker is convenient wrapper over docker (https://www.docker.com/) that simplifies containerizing GPU applications, like deep-learning frameworks. See the "Why NVIDIA Docker" page (https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Why%20NVIDIA%20Docker) for an overview of this tool.
